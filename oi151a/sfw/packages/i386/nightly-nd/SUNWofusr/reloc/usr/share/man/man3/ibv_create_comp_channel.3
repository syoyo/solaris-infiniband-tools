.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B ibv_create_comp_channel()
creates a completion event channel for the InfiniBand device context
.I context\fR.
.PP
.B ibv_destroy_comp_channel()
destroys the completion event channel
.I channel\fR.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B ibv_create_comp_channel()
returns a pointer to the created completion event channel, or NULL if the request fails.
.PP
.B ibv_destroy_comp_channel()
returns 0 on success, or the value of errno on failure (which indicates the failure reason).
.SH "NOTES"
A "completion channel" is an abstraction introduced by libibverbs that
does not exist in the InfiniBand Architecture verbs specification.  A
completion channel is essentially file descriptor that is used to
deliver completion notifications to a userspace process.  When a
completion event is generated for a completion queue (CQ), the event
is delivered via the completion channel attached to that CQ.  This may
be useful to steer completion events to different threads by using
multiple completion channels.
.PP
.B ibv_destroy_comp_channel()
fails if any CQs are still associated with the completion event
channel being destroyed.
