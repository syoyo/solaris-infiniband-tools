.TH IBV_FORK_INIT 3 2006-10-31 libibverbs "Libibverbs Programmer's Manual"
.SH "NAME"
ibv_fork_init \- initialize libibverbs to support fork()
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.nf
.B #include <infiniband/verbs.h>
.sp
.BI "int ibv_fork_init(void);
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B ibv_fork_init()
initializes libibverbs's data structures to handle
.B fork()
function calls correctly and avoid data corruption, whether
.B fork()
is called explicitly or implicitly (such as in
.B system()\fR).
.PP
It is not necessary to use this function if all parent process threads
are always blocked until all child processes end or change address
spaces via an
.B exec()
operation.
.PP
The
.B fork()
is supported as long as the parent process does not continue to run before the child
process dies or calls
.B exec()\fR.
The former can be achieved by calling 
.B wait()
until the child process ends and the latter can be achieved by application specific means.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B ibv_fork_init()
returns 0 on success, or the value of errno on failure (which indicates the failure reason).
.SH "NOTES"
.B ibv_fork_init()
works on Linux kernels supporting the
.BR MADV_DONTFORK
flag for
.B madvise()
(2.6.17 and higher).
.PP
Setting the environment variable
.BR RDMAV_FORK_SAFE
or
.BR IBV_FORK_SAFE
has the same effect as calling
.B ibv_fork_init()\fR.
.PP
Calling
.B ibv_fork_init()
will reduce performance due to an extra system call for every memory
registration, and the additional memory allocated to track memory
regions.  The precise performance impact depends on the workload and
usually will not be significant.
