.SH  DESCRIPTION
qperf measures bandwidth and latency between two nodes.  It can work
over TCP/IP as well as the RDMA transports.  On one of the nodes, qperf
is typically run with no arguments designating it the server node.  One
may then run qperf on a client node to obtain measurements such as
bandwidth, latency and cpu utilization.

In its most basic form, qperf is run on one node in server mode by
invoking it with no arguments.  On the other node, it is run with two
arguments: the name of the server node followed by the name of the
test.  A list of tests can be found in the section, TESTS.  A variety
of options may also be specified.

One can get more detailed information on qperf by using the --help
option.  Below are examples of using the --help option:

    qperf --help examples       Some examples of using qperf
    qperf --help opts           Summary of options
    qperf --help options        Description of options
    qperf --help tests          Short summary and description of tests
    qperf --help TESTNAME       More information on test TESTNAME
.SH  EXAMPLES
In these examples, we first run qperf on a node called myserver in server
mode by invoking it with no arguments.  In all the subsequent examples, we
run qperf on another node and connect to the server which we assume has a
hostname of myserver.
.TP
To run a TCP bandwidth and latency test:
qperf myserver tcp_bw tcp_lat
.TP
To run a SDP bandwidth test for 10 seconds:
qperf myserver -t 10 sdp_bw
.TP
To run a UDP latency test and then cause the server to terminate:
qperf myserver udp_lat quit
.TP
To measure the RDMA UD latency and bandwidth:
qperf myserver ud_lat ud_bw
.TP
To measure RDMA UC bi-directional bandwidth:
qperf myserver rc_bi_bw
.SH  OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-ar\fP, \fB--access_recv\fP \fIOnOff\fP
If OnOff is non-zero, data is accessed once received.  Otherwise,
data is ignored.  By default, OnOff is 0.  This helps to mimic some
applications.
.TP
\fB-a\fP, \fB--affinity\fP \fIPN\fP
Set processor affinity to PN.  Processors are numbered sequentially
from 0.  If PN is "any", any processor is allowed otherwise the
processor is limited to the one specified.
.TP
\fB-la\fP, \fB--loc_affinity\fP \fIPN\fP
Set local processor affinity to PN.
.TP
\fB-ra\fP, \fB--rem_affinity\fP \fIPN\fP
Set remote processor affinity to PN.
.TP
\fB-f\fP, \fB--flip\fP \fIOnOff\fP
Cause sender and receiver to play opposite roles.
.TP
\fB-h\fP, \fB--help\fP \fITopic\fP
Print out information about Topic.  To see the list of topics, type
qperf --help
.TP
\fB-H\fP, \fB--host\fP \fIHost\fP
Run test between the current node and the qperf running on node Host.
This can also be specified as the first non-option argument.
.TP
\fB-i\fP, \fB--id\fP \fIDevice:Port\fP
Use RDMA Device and Port.
.TP
\fB-li\fP, \fB--loc_id\fP \fIDevice:Port\fP

Use remote RDMA Device and Port.
.TP
\fB-lp\fP, \fB--listen_port\fP \fIPort\fP
Set the port we listen on to ListenPort.  This must be set to the
same port on both the server and client machines.  The default value
is 19765.
.TP
\fB-m\fP, \fB--msg_size\fP \fISize\fP
Set the message size to Size.  The default value varies by test.  It
is assumed that the value is specified in bytes however, a trailing
kib or K, mib or M, or gib or G indicates that the size is being
specified in kibibytes, mebibytes or gibibytes respectively while a
trailing kb or k, mb or m, or gb or g indicates kilobytes, megabytes
or gigabytes respectively.
.TP
\fB-mt\fP, \fB--mtu_size\fP \fISize\fP
Set the MTU size.  Only relevant to the RDMA UC/RC tests.  Units are
specified in the same manner as the --msg_size option.
.TP

Set test duration by number of messages sent instead of time.
.TP
\fB-P\fP, \fB--poll\fP \fIOnOff\fP

and determines whether they poll or wait.  If OnOff is 0, they wait;
otherwise they poll.
.TP
\fB-lP\fP, \fB--loc_poll\fP \fIOnOff\fP
Locally turn polling mode on or off.
.TP
\fB-rP\fP, \fB--rem_poll\fP \fIOnOff\fP
Remotely turn polling mode on or off.
.TP
\fB-p\fP, \fB--port\fP \fIPort\fP
Use Port to run the socket tests.  This is different from
--listen_port which is used for synchronization.  This is only
relevant for the socket tests and refers to the TCP/UDP/SDP/RDS port
that the test is run on.
.TP
\fB-e\fP, \fB--precision\fP \fIDigits\fP
Set the number of significant digits that are used to report results.
.TP
\fB-nr\fP, \fB--rd_atomic\fP \fIMax\fP

\fB-rnr\fP, \fB--rem_rd_atomic\fP \fIMax\fP
Set remote read/atomic count.
.TP
\fB-sl\fP, \fB--service_level\fP \fISL\fP
Set RDMA service level to SL.  This is only used by the RDMA tests.

.SH  BUGS
None of the RDMA tests are available if qperf is compiled without the RDMA
libraries.  The -f option is not yet implemented in many of the tests.
